# Mbed
Mbed[`mbed`](https://os.mbed.com/) is a platform and operating system for internet-connected devices based on 32-bit ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers. Such devices are also known as Internet of Things devices. The project is collaboratively developed by Arm and its technology partners.  [`wiki`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbed)

## Get Started

### [Login to the online tools](https://ide.mbed.com/compiler/)
"Instant access to your lightweight C/C++ microcontroller development environment"

The mbed Compiler provides a lightweight online C/C++ IDE that is pre-configured to let you quickly write programs, compile and download them to run on your mbed Microcontroller.

### Explore the SDK and Handbook
The mbed Software Development Kit (SDK) is a C/C++ microcontroller software platform relied upon by tens of thousands of developers to build projects fast. 

The SDK is licensed under the permissive Apache 2.0 licence, so you can use it in both commercial and personal projects with confidence.

The mbed SDK has been designed to provide enough hardware abstraction to be intuitive and concise, yet powerful enough to build complex projects. It is built on the low-level ARM CMSIS APIs, allowing you to code down to the metal if needed. In addition to RTOS, USB and Networking libraries, a cookbook of hundreds of reusable peripheral and module libraries have been built on top of the SDK by the mbed Developer Community.

### Mbed CLI
A command line tool called mbed CLI for mbed OS. mbed CLI allows you to carry out actions such as creating, importing, publishing, and building projects. Typically, you might want to use this if you're looking for a lightweight way of working with mbed OS outside of a GUI.

#### Windows
```console
# install Mbed CLI
https://os.mbed.com/blog/entry/windows-installer-for-mbed-cli/

# install git 
https://git-scm.com/download/win

# gcc Path
cmd> mbed config –G GCC_ARM_PATH “C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU Tools ARM Embedded\6 2017-q2-update\bin”

# toolchain path
cmd> mbed config -G TOOLCHAIN "GCC_ARM“

# source import and compile/build
cmd> mbed import http://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-example-blinky
cmd> cd mbed-os-example-blinky
cmd> mbed config TARGET "NUCLEO_F429ZI"
cmd> mbed compile

# copy .bin to Board 
cmd> copy mbed-os-example-blinky\BUILD\NUCLEO_F429ZI\GCC_ARM\mbed-os-example-blinky.bin {NODE_429ZI/Board}

# Support list
cmd>mbed compile –S 
```

## Introducing the Mbed Simulator
![mbed-silumator](https://os.mbed.com/media/uploads/janjongboom/simulator2.png)  
[Open the Online Mbed simulator](https://labs.mbed.com/simulator)  

The simulator shows the code editor on the left. You can change the code here, and click Compile to run it in the simulator. There is a wide range of demos available, from peripheral demos (like the popular C12832 LCD display) to network demos. Yes, that's right; you can use the full Mbed networking stack directly from the simulator. Select the demo in the dropdown menu and click Load. The demo loads automatically.

You can also add new components. For example, to blink an external LED:  
1. Load 'Blinky'.
2. Click Add component.
3. Select the Red LED.
4. Select p5 as the pin.
5. In the code, change `LED1` to `p5`
6. Click Compile.
7. Now the external LED blinks, instead of the internal LED.
