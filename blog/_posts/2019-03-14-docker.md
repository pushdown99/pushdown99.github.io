  Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.

## **Getting Started**  
1. see [Install Docker Desktop for Windows](Install Docker Desktop for Windows)
2. [`Download from Docker Hub`](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows)
3. Start Docker Desktop for Windows
4. Test your installation
    * open a terminal window (command prompt)
    * Run `docker --version` to ensure that you have a support version of docker
    ```shell
    > docker --version
    ```
    * Pull the [hello-world image](https://hub.docker.com/r/library/hello-world/) from docker hub and run a container
    ```shell
    > docker run hello-world
    ```
    * List the `hello-world` image that was downloaded from docker hub
    ```shell
    > docker image ls
    ```
    * List the `hello-world` container(thar exited after displaying "hello from docker!")
    ```shell
    > docker container ls --all
    ```

## **Explore the application**
    * Pull an image of the ubuntu OS and run an interactive terminal inside the spawned container
    ```shell
    > docker run --interactive --tty ubuntu bash 
    or
    > docker run -it ubuntu bash
    ```
    * You are in the container. At the root `#` prompt, check the `hostname` of the container
    ```shell
    root@:/ # hostname
    root@:/ # exit
    >
    ```
    * List containers with the --all option
    ```shell
    > docker container ls --all
    ```
    * Pull and run a Dockerized [nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/) web server that we name, `webserver`:
    ```shell
    > docker run --detach --publish 80:80 --name webserver nginx
    ```
    * Point your web browser at [`http://localhost`](http://localhost) to display the nginx start page
    * List only your running containers:
    ```shell
    > docker container ls
    ```
    * Stop the running nginx container by the name we assigned it, `webserver`
    ```shell
    >  docker container stop webserver
    ```
    * Remove all three containers by their names:
    ```shell
    > docker container rm webserver
    ```
