  Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.

## **Getting Started**  
1. see [Install docker desktop for windows](Install Docker Desktop for Windows)  

   ðŸ’¡ notice:  
   requires `windows 10 pro or enterprise 64-bit`.  
   for previous versions get [`Docker Toolbox`](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/).
   {:.message}

2. [`Download from Docker Hub`](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows)
3. Start `docker desktop for windows`
4. Test your installation
    * open a terminal window (command prompt)
    * run `docker --version` to ensure that you have a support version of docker
    ```shell
    > docker --version
    ```
    * pull the [hello-world image](https://hub.docker.com/r/library/hello-world/) from docker hub and run a container
    ```shell
    > docker run hello-world
    ```
    * list the `hello-world` image that was downloaded from docker hub
    ```shell
    > docker image ls
    ```
    * list the `hello-world` container(thar exited after displaying "hello from docker!")
    ```shell
    > docker container ls --all
    ```

## **Explore the application**
1. ubuntu os
    * pull an image of the ubuntu OS and run an interactive terminal inside the spawned container
    ```shell
    > docker run --interactive --tty ubuntu bash 
    or
    > docker run -it ubuntu bash
    ```
    * you are in the container. At the root `#` prompt, check the `hostname` of the container
    ```shell
    root@:/ # hostname
    root@:/ # exit
    >
    ```
    * list containers with the --all option
    ```shell
    > docker container ls --all
    ```
2. nginx webserver
    * pull and run a Dockerized [nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/) web server that we name, `webserver`:
    ```shell
    > docker run --detach --publish 80:80 --name webserver nginx
    ```
    * point your web browser at [`http://localhost`](http://localhost) to display the nginx start page
    * List only your running containers:
    ```shell
    > docker container ls
    ```
    * stop the running nginx container by the name we assigned it, `webserver`
    ```shell
    >  docker container stop webserver
    ```
    * remove all three containers by their names:
    ```shell
    > docker container rm webserver
    ```

## **[Getting Started with Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)**
1. Part 1: Orientation and setup
   * docker concepts
     * images and containers: a `container` is launched by running an `image`  
       `image` is an executable package that includes everything needed to run an application  
       `container` is a runtime instance of an image  
     * Containers and virtual machines  
       `container` runs natively on linux and shares the kernel of the host machine with other containers.   
       `virtual machine` runs a full-blown 'guest' operating system with virtual access to host resources through a hypervisor.
